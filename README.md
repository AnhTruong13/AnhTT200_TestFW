### Smart Screenshot System
- **Conditional Screenshots**: Only taken when tests fail or explicitly requested
- **Critical Screenshots**: Always taken for important verification points
- **Environment Control**: 
  - Default: Minimal screenshots (failures + critical points only)
  - `SCREENSHOTS=all`: Full documentation with all test steps
  - `SCREENSHOTS=off`: Absolute minimum (failures only)
- **Methods Available**:

    await allure.epic('Homepage');
    await allure.feature('Homepage Basic Functionality');
    await allure.story('Page Loading');
    
    await homePage.verifyHomePageIsVisible();
    await homePage.verifyPageTitle('Automation Exercise');
    await TestUtils.takeScreenshot(page, 'homepage-loaded');
});
```

- **[Screenshot Utilities](utils/screenshot-examples.md)** - Screenshot handling examples

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Configuration Optimizations
- **Viewport Screenshots**: Using `fullPage: false` prevents 32,767px size limit errors
- **Failure-Only Screenshots**: Captures screenshots only on test failures for efficiency
- **Video Storage**: Organized in `Evidence/video/` with automatic cleanup support

### NPM Script Compatibility ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: Previous PowerShell-specific environment variable syntax caused configuration warnings when passing additional Playwright arguments
- **Solution**: Implemented `cross-env` package for consistent environment variable handling across all platforms
- **Benefits**: Eliminated platform-specific script limitations and improved argument passing compatibility

### Browser Compatibility
Framework handles mixed content warnings and HTTPS certificate issues automatically with `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true`.

### Evidence Management
Use `npm run clean:evidence` to clean all test artifacts (videos, screenshots, traces, results) between test runs.

## 🤝 Contributing
1. Follow the Page Object Model pattern
2. Add appropriate Allure annotations (@epic, @feature, @story)
3. Include error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Document new utilities in the utils directory
5. Update manual steps for new test scenarios

- ✅ **All screenshots captured** for comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Initial page state documented
- ✅ Every form interaction recorded
- ✅ Complete test journey preserved
